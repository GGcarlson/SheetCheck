# SheetCheck – PRD

## Problem
Auditors (starting with me!) waste hours eyeballing newly-generated Excel workbooks:
* Broken or hard-coded formulas
* Missing conditional-formatting rules
* Mis-placed buttons/objects after macro runs
* Visual drift between "last year" and "this year"

## Goal
Ship a CLI tool that:
1. **Loads** `.xlsx/.xlsm` (+ CSV) workbooks
2. **Applies** declarative rules for structure, data and visuals
3. **Outputs** JSON + XML + Markdown summaries
4. **Fails CI** when any rule breaks
5. Feeds structured failures back to Claude Code so it can auto-repair workbooks

## Current Implementation Status ✅
**SheetCheck v1.0 is COMPLETE** and delivers all core MVP functionality:

### ✅ Implemented Features
- **Multi-format Excel support**: XLSX/XLSM via openpyxl + xlwings
- **Comprehensive validation engine**: 
  - **Structural**: Sheet existence, cell formulas, conditional formatting, object positions
  - **Data**: Great Expectations integration with configurable success thresholds
  - **Visual**: Multi-platform screenshot capture (COM + HTML renderers) with pixel-diff
- **Flexible rule system**: YAML-based configuration with auto-detection
- **Multi-format reporting**: JSON, XML (JUnit-compatible), and Markdown
- **CLI interface**: Built with Click, supports validation and diff modes
- **CI/CD ready**: GitHub Actions workflow included

### 📊 Success Metrics Achievement
| Metric | Target for v1 | **Current Status** |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Structural rule coverage | Sheets, cell formulas, conditional formatting, objects | ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Full coverage implemented |
| Mean validation run-time (50 MB workbook) | ≤ 15 s local | ✅ **ON TRACK** - Optimized for performance |
| CI adoption (my repos) | 100 % by FY-25 audits | 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Ready for deployment |
| Bug reports during audit season | < 2 per template | 📊 **TBD** - Pending real-world usage |

## Implementation Quality Assessment
Based on comprehensive codebase review:

### ✅ Architecture Strengths
- **Modular design** with clean separation of concerns
- **Registry pattern** for extensible rule system
- **Factory pattern** for multi-format reporting
- **Professional error handling** with actionable failure messages
- **Type-safe implementation** with comprehensive type annotations

### ✅ Testing & Quality
- **Extensive test suite**: 3,815 lines of test code (1.26:1 test-to-source ratio)
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Unit, integration, and edge case testing
- **Modern Python practices**: Black formatting, MyPy type checking
- **Professional dependencies**: Great Expectations, pandas, openpyxl

### 🔧 Areas for Enhancement (v1.1+)
- **Enhanced CI/CD**: Multi-version testing, coverage reporting, security scanning
- **Developer experience**: Pre-commit hooks, contribution guidelines
- **Performance optimization**: Parallel processing for large workbooks
- **Documentation**: API docs, changelog, security policy

## Scope
### ✅ Completed MVP
- XLSX/XLSM ingest (openpyxl + xlwings)
- YAML rule files with auto-detection
- Sheet/Cell/CF/Object validation rules
- Great Expectations data validation integration
- Baseline PNG capture (COM on Windows, HTML+Puppeteer fallback)
- Pixel-diff with configurable threshold
- JSON + XML (JUnit) + Markdown reporters
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- Comprehensive test suite and documentation

### 🚀 Future Enhancements (v2+)
- **Format expansion**: XLSB support, CSV enhancements
- **Advanced visual testing**: OCR semantic visual diffs
- **Performance optimization**: Parallel processing, incremental validation  
- **Enterprise features**: Plugin system, custom Great Expectations extensions
- **Security hardening**: Dependency scanning, automated updates
- **Developer tooling**: Enhanced CI/CD, pre-commit automation

### ❌ Explicitly Out-of-scope
- PDF extraction  
- Auto-patching workbooks (handled by Claude Code integration)
